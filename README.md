# StressWebsite
#### 20% Project - 1st Semester
This project was for the 20% Project for the AT: Computer Science class. I have uploaded
a couple of pictures that I used for my project. Aditionally, the user will need to
download the IDE of Webstorm so that they are able to fully get the picture of how the website
looks. Download Webstorm from the internet and open a new project and give it a title. Within this,
copy all of the code in the StressWebsite.html file. This will then allow for the user to reach the top
right corner and press the chrome button (or any search engine of their choice) which allows for them to 
access the website and then fully go through the content of each page! In the future, I want to add 
an intermediate section as well as an interactive planner. The planner would allow for students to input
their schdule and then the website will physically enter spaces to de-stress the students.
